# Opera GX Mod: GitHub Square PFPs
The **profile pictures** you upload to **GitHub** are saved as square images, not circles, but they are displayed as circles on profile pages.

This mod makes it so that hovering over a profile picture will transition it to reveal the full square image!

## Installation
The mod is publicly available for download on [GX.store](https://store.gx.me/mods/65y0n4/github-square-pfp/) (for free).

You do, of course, need to have the Opera GX browser to use this.
